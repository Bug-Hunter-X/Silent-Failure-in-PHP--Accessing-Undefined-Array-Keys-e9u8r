In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this code:

```php
<?php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["nonExistentKey"] = "someValue";

//Attempting to access a key that doesn't exist
echo $myArray["anotherNonExistentKey"];
?>
```

PHP's loose typing allows this to run without a fatal error.  Instead of throwing a notice or exception, it simply outputs nothing. This silent failure can be very hard to debug.
