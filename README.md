# Silent Failure in PHP: Accessing Undefined Array Keys

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in PHP: the silent failure when accessing undefined array keys. PHP's loose typing allows this to happen without throwing an error or warning, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.php` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file shows how to mitigate this issue using isset() or array_key_exists().

This is a significant issue for code reliability and maintainability.
